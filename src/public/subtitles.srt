1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The rain painted the streets of Paris in silvery strokes, shimmering under dim lantern light.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,120
A woman clutching her umbrella paused near a bridge.

3
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:12,440
Her eyes meet his, a man standing alone, drenched, staring into the Seine.

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:16,780
You're lost, aren't you? she asked, her voice soft yet wary.

5
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:20,840
He smiled faintly, but something about him felt off.

6
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:25,360
Their conversation unfolded slowly, as if the city itself were listening.

7
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:30,600
They shared stories, hers a tourist exploring Paris for the first time, his, a writer searching

8
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,920
for inspiration.

9
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:37,119
But as she leaned closer, her gaze landed on the edge of his sleeve, dark stains smeared

10
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:38,119
and unsettling.

11
00:00:38,119 --> 00:00:40,560
Is that blood? she whispered.

12
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,560
He froze.

13
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,119
The air thickened, suffocating.

14
00:00:44,119 --> 00:00:46,759
His smile faded, revealing something darker.

15
00:00:46,759 --> 00:00:48,299
You shouldn't have noticed that.

16
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:49,400
Her heart raced.

17
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,500
Footsteps echoed in the distance.

18
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:55,240
She turned to run, but his grip closed around her wrist like a vice.

19
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:58,799
Paris has secrets, he murmured, his voice low and icy.

20
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:00,959
And you just stumbled into mine.

21
00:01:00,959 --> 00:01:05,120
The lanterns flickered, their glow faltering, as the city seemed to close around them.
